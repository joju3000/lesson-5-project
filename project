        <h4>CRC in Brief
            WE OFFER YOUR WARDS THE BEST
            Christ the Redeemer’s College was founded on the 1st of October 1996 by the General Overseer of the Redeemed
            Christian
            Church Of God, Pastor E.A. Adeboye. The College is situated on 21.8 hectares of land along the Sagamu-Ikorodu
            Road
            (Km.14), ChristHill in Ogun State Nigeria. It is a very serene environment nestled among the Kola nut Trees for
            which
            the ancient town of Sagamu is well known. This is an environment very conducive for teaching and learning
            process. Ours
            is a secondary school of high repute, built on Christian ethics and run on biblical principles to meet the
            highest needs
            of general National and International Educational requirements.</h4>
        <h4>Christ The Redeemer’s College, ChristHill, Sagamu is one of the schools in the CRSM ( Christ The Redeemer’s
            School
            Movement), an arm of the directorate of Children & Teens Education of the Redeemed Christian Church of God
            (RCCG).
            Pastor (Mrs.) Folu Adeboye, the wife of the General overseer, Pastor E.A. Adeboye, is the director of Children &
            Teen
            Education and the Chairman of the CRSM.</h4>
        <p>OUR VISION</p>
        <h4> 1981, began a new era in the Redeemed Christian Church of God, when Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye became the
            General Overseer. Among the very first prophecies he pronounced was one to do with education. He talked of a
            school
            system that would be totally Christian, based on the word of God, run by spirit-filled Christians and on
            Christian
            principles. This educational system would start at the pre-school level and run through to the tertiary level.
    
            If no one took him seriously, one person certainly did and she did not let the vision slip from her.
            Mother-in-Israel,
            our Mummy Pastor (Mrs.) Folu Adeboye believed in the word of God as spoken by His prophet and so some 25years
            ago, she
            started the vision rolling by establishing what is today the first in a chain of pre-school/primary and
            secondary
            schools all across our nation, Nigeria.
    
            It is pertinent to note that CRC, was the first Secondary School in the link to be established when it was
            dedicated on
            1st October, 1996. The vision has since reached the tertiary level with the opening of the Redeemer’s University
            for All
            Nations (RUN). A great vision on the run.</h4>
